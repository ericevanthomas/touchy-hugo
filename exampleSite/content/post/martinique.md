### Martinique Impressions & Experiences

<span class="impressions">French department. Je né parle pá Francês. Frequent bursts of rain. Getting better at anchoring in high winds. Expensive restaurants but cheap baguettes and wine. Sidewalks. Nautical playground at dock. Felt isolated in the beginning. First fake Christmas tree. Leon declares his love for nature. Feeling like ghosts not knowing the language. Art in roundabouts. Remnants of COVID vaccine protests. Motorcyclists ride in between cars. Hiking trails. Walk by a nude beach and Leon and Margot don’t notice. Rainbows every day. Rent a car. Highways, roundabouts, and ramps. Traffic jams. Searching for alone time. Kids scooting in the square. Four attempts to get booster. A lot of commerce. Making friends makes all the difference. Morning run club. Children love a good stage. Confused firefly appears in boat amongst lights on Christmas tree. Wake up to leaf blowers and roosters echoing from land. Family bickering can be worse on a boat but the making up is better. Pirate Beach. Treehouses.</span>
