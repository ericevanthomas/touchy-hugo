### Saint John Impressions & Experiences

<span class="impressions">Mega yachts. Antigua 600 race. Glassy water in Falmouth. Reunite with cruising friends from SV Mowzer. They leave for good. Leon builds a robot. Many fees to enter Antigua. Abandoned casino in Jolly Harbor. Thousands of dusty slot machines left behind. Eric’s sister visits. Joy of family. Sea sickness. Lots of salty chips. Turquoise waters. Robert De Niro's unwelcome luxury development on Barbuda. Margot spots a band of horses running on the beach at twilight. Magnificent frigate bird sanctuary. Red throats inflate like balloons. Great Bird Island is a giant terrarium. Fierce, unrelenting winds develop. Eric has debilitating back spasms. Can’t sail. Feeling lonely without support. Wind snaps dinghy line. Burgers and shakes at Sweet T's. Leon finds artifact in ruins.</span>
