### Grenadines Impressions & Experiences

<span class="impressions">Boats selling lobster and banana bread. Raise yellow quarantine flag and wait for clearance. Hot walk to beautiful suspension bridge on Union Island. Forgot snacks. Bought eight sweet coconut buns, a loaf of bread, a slice of cake, a Sprite, and a beer. Grenadines popular spot for kite surfing. Stunning entrance to Salt Whistle Bay in Mayreau. White sand beach lined with brightly colored sarongs blowing in the wind. Island dotted with cactus, empty restaurants, an abandoned hotel, and children’s laughter. Grocery store called First Stop. 27-knot gusts at night. Charters come in and out. No ATM. Turtles swimming around boat in Tobago Cays. Eating more from cans. Alex feels sublime on her birthday. Swimming near purple sea fans. Eric spots a nurse shark. Tired from always trying to keep kids safe. Kids buzzing with energy at 6:30am, like a shaken up soda bottle waiting to pop. Exhausted. Tears on the beach. Highs are high and lows are low. Nudity is illegal in Bequia, but so is camouflage clothing. Leon changed his camo shorts. Jay’s Sweet Spot feels like home. Fruit and veggie stalls on every corner. People sit with each other rather than sit with their phones.</span>
