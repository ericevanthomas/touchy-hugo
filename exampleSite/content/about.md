When we told our friends that we wanted to live on a boat for a year with our two young kids, some said, “That sounds really hard” and others said, “You’re living the dream.” The reality is that both are true. We have been planning this adventure for years, wanting to expose our children to new cultures, turquoise waters, challenge, beauty, and the wonders of sailing. A dozen Excel spreadsheets later, here we are, making it happen. For the next 10-months we’ll be sailing north up through the Caribbean back to the United States, stopping where we can. We have an idea of where we want to go but also know that the future is uncertain.

        <p class="card-text">Leon is a bright, sensitive, curious, and energetic five-year-old. He likes to call himself “The Son of Sherlock Holmes.” You can often find Leon solving mysteries, writing stories, listening to audio books, or asking questions about how the world works as well as his place in it. He used to hang back at playgrounds but now he dives right in. Leon can out-tag any kid and would eat cookies all day if we let him. </p>

        <p class="card-text">Margot is a smart, loquacious, adventurous, tender, and squirmy two-year-old. Her favorite phrases are, “I can do it myself” or “why?”. Margot learned to put her own shoes on at eighteen months, on the correct feet. She is usually really happy until she is really not. You can often find Margot taking care of her baby doll, wrestling with her brother, touching every button and pulling every handle around, or swinging in a baby swing. </p>
